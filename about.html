                <h2>Creating Impact Through Design</h2>
                <div class="bio-content">
                    <p>
                        For over two decades, I've been driven by a simple but powerful belief: the best products emerge 
                        when deep user empathy meets hands-on creation. As a designer, maker, and leader, I've spent my 
                        career building teams and capabilities that don't just create beautiful products—they transform 
                        entire categories and create lasting business value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey began at the University of Cincinnati's College of Design, where I was named Industrial 
                        Design Student of the Year in 1999. Those formative years taught me that great design requires both 
                        strategic thinking and the ability to make ideas tangible. This philosophy has guided my career ever 
                        since, from my early days working across continents—Hong Kong, Kobe, Cincinnati, Frankfurt—to leading 
                        global design teams across North America, Europe, and Asia.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Building Capabilities, Not Just Products</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        What excites me most isn't just designing the next great product—it's building the teams, processes, 
                        and capabilities that enable sustained innovation. At Procter & Gamble, where I've spent the last 20+ 
                        years, I've had the privilege of leading design organizations through transformative change. One of my 
                        proudest achievements was developing P&G's first Digital Design Capability, taking it from external 
                        dependencies to a fully internalized team that now tackles our category's most important consumer needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This capability-building mindset extends to how I lead. I believe in creating environments where designers 
                        can do their best work—where rapid prototyping, user co-creation, and strategic thinking aren't just 
                        buzzwords, but daily practices. My team of designers across three continents doesn't just execute; 
                        they innovate, challenge assumptions, and push boundaries.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Design as Strategic Advantage</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my career, I've seen firsthand how design can be a powerful strategic tool. Whether it was 
                        leading the Pantene global restage, reimagining HairCare packaging systems that saved $55 million annually 
                        while reducing complexity by 30%, or developing the vision for what became the award-winning Oral-B iO 
                        platform, I've always approached design challenges through both a creative and business lens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My executive education at Harvard Business School—in both Launching New Ventures and Leading Product 
                        Innovation—reinforced this dual perspective. Great design isn't just aesthetically pleasing; it drives 
                        measurable business outcomes. The programs I've led or co-developed have generated hundreds of millions 
                        in topline growth for the Oral Care category over the past 13 years.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Oral-B iO: A Case Study in Vision and Value</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The Oral-B iO project exemplifies my approach to design leadership. This wasn't just about creating another 
                        electric toothbrush—it was about reimagining the entire brushing experience through the lens of user needs, 
                        technological possibility, and brand equity. Leading the vision development and design across multiple 
                        innovation verticals—product, accessories, materials & finishes, and human-computer interface—required 
                        orchestrating insights from consumer research, engineering, marketing, and manufacturing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The impact speaks for itself: Oral-B iO has generated hundreds of millions in topline sales growth while 
                        simultaneously earning some of the industry's most prestigious design awards—German Design Award Gold, iF 
                        Design Award, Red Dot, and CES Innovation Award. This dual success validates not just the aesthetic and 
                        functional excellence of the product, but proves that great design directly drives business results. The 
                        recognition demonstrates that when you get the user experience right, commercial success follows.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Philosophy: Empathy, Prototyping, Co-creation</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        My design philosophy centers on three pillars: deep user empathy, rapid visualization through prototyping, 
                        and user co-creation. I believe you can't design great experiences from a conference room—you need to be in 
                        the field, understanding real needs, building quick prototypes, and iterating with users. This hands-on 
                        approach, combined with strategic foresight, allows teams to take calculated risks and innovate boldly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether I'm sketching concepts, building CAD models in Fusion 360, designing interfaces in Figma, or even 
                        coding light front-end experiences in Swift or Flutter, I stay close to the craft. Leadership doesn't mean 
                        stepping away from making—it means modeling the behaviors you want to see in your team.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        As I continue my work in design leadership, I remain energized by opportunities to step-change industries and 
                        create value through design. With over 300 patents to my name spanning product innovation, interface design, 
                        packaging, and manufacturing processes, I'm constantly exploring new ways to solve problems and create 
                        delightful experiences.
                    </p>

                        But beyond the patents and awards, what drives me is the opportunity to mentor the next generation of designers, 
                        build capabilities that outlast any single project, and continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible when 
                        empathy, creativity, and strategic thinking come together.

                        <p>
                            Great products start with genuine understanding of user needs, behaviors, and pain points. 
                            I believe in spending time in the field, observing real use cases, and building empathy 
                            before jumping to solutions.

                            Ideas need to be tangible to be evaluated. Through sketching, physical prototypes, and 
                            digital mockups, I believe in making concepts real quickly so teams can learn, iterate, 
                            and improve faster.

                            The best insights come from designing with users, not just for them. Involving users in 
                            the design process ensures solutions truly meet their needs and creates products people love.
